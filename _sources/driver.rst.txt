Driver
============

* The driver class is configured to run for the realsense intel L515 and D435 cameras.

The driver class provides ...


.. code-block:: python

   import intel_realsense_devices
   print(f'current version of the library is {intel_realsense_devices.__version__}')
   from intel_realsense_devices.driver import Driver
   driver = Driver()
   driver.init(serial_number="YOUR SERIAL NUMBER")

To check what device current driver is connected

.. code-block:: python

   driver.print_device_info()

To see if there are other devices currently connected to your PC 

.. code-block:: python
   
   print(driver.find_devices())

In order to test if your device is connected and color image and depth piplines are configured run:

.. code-block:: python
   
   driver.live_stream_test()

Set laser intensity function:

.. code-block:: python
   
   driver.set_laser_intensity(laser_power = 100)


If the laser intensity is too strong, the reciver will saturate similairly to
how a image can be overexposed. If it's too weak the system to
get any information. Adjusting the laser power manually may give better results considering 
the specific distance and objects for the use case.
